This module is agnostic to any JS framework and has only one peer dependency: [qs](https://github.com/ljharb/qs)

To create a Flayyer template and an account please refer to: [flayyer.com](https://flayyer.com?ref=flayyer-js)

## Installation

This module supports Node.js, Browser and can be bundled with any tool such as Rollup, Webpack, etc and includes Typescript definitions.

```sh
yarn add @flayyer/flayyer

# or with npm:
npm install --save @flayyer/flayyer
```

## Usage

The main difference between `Flayyer.io` and `Flayyer.ai` is:

* **Flayyer.io requires you to explicitly declare template and variables for the images to render**.
* **Flayyer.ai uses the [rules defined on your dashboard](https://flayyer.com/dashboard/_/projects) to decide how to handle every image**, then fetches and analyse the website for variables and information to render the image.

### Flayyer.ai

This is the easiest way to use Flayyer. The following snippet enables our platform to analyse the content of every page to extract relevant information and use it to generate image previews.

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { FlayyerAI } from "@flayyer/flayyer";

function Head() {
  const flayyer = new FlayyerAI({
    project: "my-project",
    path: `/products/1`,
  });
  const url = flayyer.href();
  // > https://flayyer.ai/v2/my-project/_/__v=1596906866/products/1

  return (
    <head>
      <meta property="og:image" content={url} />
      {/* Declare the original image so you can use it on your templates */}
      <meta property="flayyer:image" content="https://yoursite.com/image/products/1.png" />
    </head>
  );
}
```

Remember to dynamically get the current path for each page. If you are using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) you should probably do it like this:

```js
import { useRouter } from 'next/router'
import { FlayyerAI } from "@flayyer/flayyer";

function SEO() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const flayyer = new FlayyerAI({
    project: "my-project",
    path: router.asPath,
  });

  // ...
}
```

### Flayyer.io

After installing this module you can format URLs. Here is an example with React.js, but note this can be used with any framework:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Flayyer } from "@flayyer/flayyer";

function Head() {
  const flayyer = new Flayyer({
    tenant: "tenant",
    deck: "deck",
    template: "template",
    variables: {
      title: "Hello world!",
      image: "https://yoursite.com/image/products/1.png",
    },
  });
  const url = flayyer.href();
  // > https://flayyer.io/v2/tenant/deck/template.jpeg?__v=1596906866&title=Hello+world%21&image=...

  return (
    <head>
      <meta property="og:image" content={url} />
    </head>
  );
}
```

Variables can be complex arrays and objects.

```js
const flayyer = new Flayyer({
  // ...
  variables: {
    items: [
      { text: "Oranges", count: 12 },
      { text: "Apples", count: 14 },
    ],
  },
  meta {
    id: "slug-or-id", // To identify the resource in our analytics report
  }
});
```

**IMPORTANT: variables must be serializable.**

To decode an URL for debugging purposes:

```js
console.log(decodeURI(url));
// > https://flayyer.io/v2/tenant/deck/template.jpeg?title=Hello+world!&__v=123
```

### CommonJS

In plain Node.js you can import this module as:

```js
const { Flayyer, FlayyerAI } = require("@flayyer/flayyer");
```

## FAQ

### What is the difference between Flayyer.ai and Flayyer.io?

See [Usage](#usage) ðŸ‘†

### Is it compatible with Vue and other frameworks?

This is framework-agnostic, you can use this library on any framework on any platform.

### What if the `__v=` thing?

Most social networks caches images, we use this variable to invalidate their caches but we ignore it on our system to prevent unnecessary renders. **We strongly recommend it and its generated by default.**

Pass `meta: { v: null }` to disabled it (not recommended).
